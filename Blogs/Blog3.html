    <h1>The Science of First Impressions: How to Make People Like You in the First 7 Seconds</h1>
    <h3>Introduction: Why the First Few Seconds Matter</h3>
    <p>You’ve heard the saying, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” Science backs it up. Studies from Princeton University suggest people form opinions about others in as little as 1/10 of a second—and those impressions tend to stick.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re meeting a client, going on a first date, or introducing yourself at a networking event, those initial moments can set the tone for the entire relationship. The good news? You can learn how to make those moments work in your favor.</p>

    <h3>The Psychology Behind First Impressions</h3>
    <p>Humans are wired for quick judgment—it’s a survival mechanism. Our ancestors needed to instantly assess whether someone was a friend or a threat. Today, that instinct remains, even though the “threats” are more likely social or professional than physical.

First impressions rely heavily on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Appearance – What you wear, your grooming, and body language</li>
    <li>Voice & Tone – How you speak can convey confidence or hesitation</li>
    <li>Energy – The emotional vibe you project (positive, neutral, or negative)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Common Mistakes That Ruin First Impressions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Overpowering Perfume/Cologne – Distracting and overwhelming</li>
        <li>Checking Your Phone – Signals disinterest and disrespect.</li>
        <li>Poor Grooming – Messy hair or unkempt clothes can imply carelessness.</li>
        <li>Overtalking About Yourself – People remember how you made them feel, not how impressive you sounded</li>
        <li>Monotone Voice – Makes you seem bored or disengaged.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Science of Likeability</h3>
    <p>Psychologists identify three key traits that make someone instantly likable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Competence – You seem capable and reliable.</li>
        <li>Warmth – You come across as kind and approachable</li>
        <li>Authenticity – You feel genuine, not scripted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Balancing competence and warmth is crucial. Too much focus on competence without warmth can make you seem intimidating. Too much warmth without competence can make you seem inexperienced.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>First impressions happen fast—but they’re not random. By consciously refining how you present yourself in those first few seconds, you can influence how people perceive you and open doors to new relationships and opportunities.

So next time you meet someone, remember:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stand tall.</li>
    <li>Smile slowly and genuinely.</li>
    <li>Make eye contact</li>
    <li>Show interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>These small, deliberate actions can turn a simple introduction into the start of something meaningful.</p>
