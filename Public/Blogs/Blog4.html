    <h3>Introduction: A New Era of Work</h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction—it’s part of our everyday lives. From voice assistants and automated chatbots to AI-driven hiring tools and self-driving cars, the workplace is transforming at a pace never seen before.</p>
    <p>While some fear job loss due to automation, history shows that technological revolutions don’t just eliminate jobs—they create new ones. The key is to adapt, learn, and equip yourself with skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p>
