    <h3>Introduction: The Hidden Cost of Digital Clutter</h3>
    <p>We live in a world where our pockets hold more computing power than the machines that sent humans to the moon. While this connectivity has brought incredible convenience, it has also quietly filled our lives with digital noise—notifications pinging every few minutes, endless emails, crowded desktops, and social media feeds we can’t seem to scroll away from.</p>
    <p>Digital minimalism is a deliberate approach to technology use, where you strip away the non-essential and keep only the tools, apps, and online habits that genuinely add value to your life. It’s not about rejecting technology—it’s about controlling it before it controls you.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Why Digital Minimalism Matters More Than Ever</h3>
     <ol id="orderedlist">
        <li>Mental Clarity
Every notification, unread badge, or digital distraction drains a little bit of your focus. Over time, this constant interruption reduces your ability to think deeply and creatively.</li>
<li>Reduced Stress
Studies show that constant connectivity increases stress levels. A cluttered inbox or chaotic phone screen subconsciously signals “unfinished business” to your brain.</li>
<li>Better Time Management
The average person spends over 3 hours a day on their phone. Imagine reclaiming just half of that time for hobbies, relationships, or rest.</li>
<li>Improved Privacy and Security
Fewer apps and accounts mean fewer chances for your data to be misused or stolen.</li>
     </ol>

    <h3>Digital Minimalism Tools</h3>
    <ul id="unorderedlist">
        <li>Freedom – Blocks distracting apps and websites.</li>
        <li>Notion or Trello – Organizes tasks and projects in one place.</li>
        <li>Google Photos or Apple Photos – For organized, backed-up photo libraries.</li>
        <li>LastPass – Simplifies password management (reducing account chaos).</li>
        <li>RescueTime – Tracks your digital habits</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>Mindset Shift: From FOMO to JOMO</h3>
    <p>Digital minimalism often triggers the fear of missing out (FOMO). But with time, this transforms into the joy of missing out (JOMO)—the peace of knowing you’re focusing on what truly matters, not chasing every trend or notification.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Technology is a powerful tool—but like any tool, it can be overwhelming when overused. Digital minimalism isn’t about abandoning modern life; it’s about making room for more meaningful moments, deeper focus, and authentic connections. By consciously curating your online world, you reclaim control over your attention, time, and peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Start small: delete one distracting app today, turn off a handful of notifications, or set your phone aside for a tech-free evening. These little steps, taken consistently, can transform your relationship with technology—and with yourself.</p>
